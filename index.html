            Countdown to Zero is an initiative to eliminate as much household
            waste as much as possible in american homes by 2035. This is
            important because pollution and waste may cause our planet to have
            hostile living conditions in the near future if steps are not taken
            immediately. Articles are frequently released on this website to
            educate people about the climate crisis and what they can do about
            it.
