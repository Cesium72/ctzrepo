      <h1>The Dishwasher</h1>

      <p>
        Hi! This month's conservation topic is something that uses a
        <u>lot</u> of water and energy: the dishwasher. This everyday household
        machine was patented in 1850 by Joel Houston. It was very unlike the
        dishwashers we see today, as it was simply a wooden crate with a
        hand-turned wheel to splash water and scrub the dishes.
      </p>
      <h3>Drawbacks of the Dishwasher</h3>
      <p>
        Although the dishwasher is a very useful machine, it has quite an
        environmental footprint. It uses electricity to run its functions and
        heat up the water, it uses water to wash the dishes, and dish soap takes
        many chemicals to produce.
      </p>
      <h3>Ways to Save with the Dishwasher</h3>
      <h4>Method 1:</h4>
      <p>
        Use that hunk of metal in your kitchen. Even though washing dishes by
        hand may appear to be more eco-friendly, it still uses soap, it still
        uses energy to heat the water, and worst of all, it uses around 6-7
        times as much water as a dishwasher. Of course, some dishes can't be
        washed in the dishwasher. Most dishwashers I've seen can't fit a mixing
        bowl or a saucepan (If yours can, then you have a better dishwasher than
        me).
      </p>
      <h4>Method 2:</h4>
      <p>
        Simply use less dishes. When you sit down for a meal or even have a
        party, there's no need to use a seperate dish for each course. If you
        rinse your dishes in between courses (or even better, scrape them off to
        save water), you won't have to worry about cross-contamination.
      </p>
      <h4>Method 3:</h4>
      <p>
        Adjust your dishwasher settings. By simply turning off "heated dry" or
        "extra scented," the total impact adds up over time and helps your ol'
        washer's conservation a <i>lot</i>.
      </p>
      <h4>Method 4:</h4>
      <p>
        Here's a long term goal for the ambitious: a new dishwasher! New
        technology is on the rise, and ecological dishwashers are now hot on the
        market. Bonus: this investment will pay off when your water bill comes.
      </p>
      <h3>Spread the word!</h3>
      <p>
        The basic act of telling someone about conservation can lead to lots of
        change. If someone else in your household pays the bills, you could try
        to convince them that saving water and energy can reduce these monthly
        fees. The more people who know about environmental troubles, the less
        critical they become. <br />See you next month! Until next time,
        remember that YOU can make a difference.
